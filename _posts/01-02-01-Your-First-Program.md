## Hello World! {#hello_world}

Let's create, build, and run a simple program in Golang. You will need to have
properly installed Golang in order to do all the steps.

Let's look at the code:

{% highlight golang %}
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
{% endhighlight %}
