## Use the Current Stable Version (1.12) {#use_the_current_stable_version_title}

We will be using [Golang](https://golang.org/) 1.12 for this project. If you do
not already have Golang installed, visit the [downloads](https://golang.org/dl/)
page to snag it. There are [install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)
if you need help for the install.


## Why Golang? {#why_golang_title}

Why are we using Golang?

First and foremost, it is my ([clagraff](https://github.com/clagraff") favorite
language to work in.

For more practical reasons, it:

* has a fantastic community
* _tons_ of open source libraries
* doesn't encourage too much "magic"
* concurrency model
* strongly, statically typed

## Learning Material {#learning_material_title}
If this will be your first time using Golang, there is a huge amount of
learning material available to you. Below are some highlights, but feel free
to look for more on your own.
