# Welcome

Welcome to Build an API, where we go step-by-step building out an API. 

The purpose of this is to act as a guide, leading you along a journey of building
out a robust, well-rounded API. We will focus on a variety of topics, including:
authentication & authorization, logging, metrics, containerization, deployments,
CI/CD, project organization, client interfaces, and more.

We will build up an API in steps; this means the code we start with may not 
necessarily fit "best practices". We will try to indicate when this happens; we 
want to show a natural evolution of an API, which sometimes means having bad code
we can purposefully refactor later.

This is a living document and will continue to be updated with more helpful information
and examples as they become available.
